## What are slots?

Vue supports slots, which provide a way distribute content between components. They're an outstanding way to make your components _truly_ reusable.

:books: [Read the documentation for motivation and overview!](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Content-Distribution-with-Slots)

### What are scoped slots? :microscope:

As of Vue version 2.1.0, **scoped slots** extend the capability of slots. One can now pass a template to a slot; the template is rendered in the parent scope, but it has access to child data.

This is a more advanced pattern, but that doesn't mean you can't learn them!

> **Note**: We'll use a :microscope: to indicate items that have to do with scoped slot

Here's some material to help motivate scoped slots:
